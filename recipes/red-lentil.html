    <h2>This is a lentil soup that defies expectations of what lentil soup can be.</h2>
    <p>Based on a Turkish lentil soup, mercimek corbasi, it is light, spicy and a bold red color (no murky brown here):
        a
        revelatory dish that takes less than an hour to make. The cooking is painless. Sauté onion and garlic in oil,
        then
        stir in tomato paste, cumin and chile powder and cook a few minutes more to intensify flavor. Add broth, water,
        red
        lentils (which cook faster than their green or black counterparts) and diced carrot, and simmer for 30 minutes.
        Purée half the mixture and return it to the pot for a soup that strikes the balance between chunky and
        pleasingly
        smooth. A hit of lemon juice adds an up note that offsets the deep cumin and chile flavors.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal), plus more to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>Pinch of chili powder or ground cayenne, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1 quart chicken or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1 cup red lentils</li>
        <li>1 large carrot, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>
            Juice of ½ lemon, more to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, heat 3 tablespoons oil over high until hot and shimmering. Add onion and garlic, and sauté
            until golden, about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in tomato paste, cumin, salt, black pepper and chili powder, and sauté for 2 minutes longer.</li>
        <li>Add broth, 2 cups water, lentils and carrot. Bring to a simmer, then partly cover pot and turn heat to
            medium-low. Simmer until lentils are soft, about 30 minutes. Taste and add salt if necessary.</li>
        <li>Using an immersion or regular blender or a food processor, purée half the soup, then add it back to pot. The
            soup should be somewhat chunky.</li>
        <li>Reheat soup if necessary, then stir in lemon juice and cilantro. Serve soup drizzled with good olive oil and
            dusted lightly with chili powder, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
